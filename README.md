# House-Divider


Description: Back in my high school, we are divided into four big houses(like in Harry Potter) and till we graduate. Houses compete with each other. What bothers is that
the groups are divided by humans, and the result is that one group is very strong and one is super weak. So, I am thinking to make a server to divider houses. It saves time
and more fair. We can quantitify people(gender, IQ, athlecity, EQ, passion, etc) and divide them into four averaged groups. 

Structure:
One front end-to upload a excel or json file to the server-No idea how to make it. I know how to post through curl.
Server-Kotlin, brute force through all the combinations and return the best result.
